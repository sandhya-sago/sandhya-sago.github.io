      <p>Google BigQuery has a few open datasets, of which GitHub data is one. However, one can get only 16k rows in a 
        query without paying extra for storage. So, I got a list of 16k most watched repositories from sample_repos (which 
        is a list of 400k repositories which got more than 2 starts during Jan-May 2016). GitHub data is available at 
        <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/bigquery-public-data:github_repos">Google Big Query</a>.

    The most insight into the usage of different languages can be obtained by a dendrogram with a heatmap. Only the
    top 19 languages by number of repositories they appear in have been taken, and the rest of almost 200 languages
    have been lumped into "Others". Each sqare 
    represents the number of repositories that have both the languages. The diagonal elements are the total number of
    repositories for that particular language.  White and red indicate more number of repositories, and blue less.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most commonly used single languages are Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Shell. HTML/CSS/JavaScript have the 
    most number of co-occurances and is indicated in red. C/C++/Makefile form another strong group in light blue. Python
    also seems to form a group with C/C++/Makefile, but looking at the number of repositories they share, we can 
    conclude that its not a strong co-occurance. Another group emerges with Ruby/Objective-C/Swift.  </p>

    <p><h4>Chord Diagram</h4> <small class="text-muted">Not so insightful</small></p><br>
    <p>I find that the chord diagram is not a very good representation of the data because:</p>
    <li>
        It does not show one-to-many relationships. For example, most of the repositories with JavaScript will have both html and css. 
        This is represented as JavaScript-HTML and JavaScript-css, but not all together.
    </li>
    <li>
        The size of the arc does not represent the number of repos in the dataset. For example, the number of repos that use JavaScript is 
        about 6k in my dataset, however, the arc is about 17k. This is because of multiple languages in each repo. For example, if a repo has JavaScript, 
        HTML, CSS and Python, the length of the arc would be 3.
    </li>
    <p>Still, it is a good visualization to show that almost every language is used in conjunction with another one.</p>

    <p><h4>Force Directed Graph <small class="text-muted">Fancy, but not useful</small></h4></p>
    <p>This force-directed graph shows the least amount of information of all. The distance is inversly proportional
    to the number of repositories that share those two languages. However, the steady state just shows them in a symmetric
    pattern</p>
